# 📚 Why Excel?

Excel is one of the most practical tools for **analyzing, visualizing, and understanding data**.  
It’s used by companies, engineers, analysts, and project managers around the world.  

As an IT student, mastering Excel gives me:
- A strong foundation before moving to data analytics tools (Power BI, Python, etc.)
- The ability to automate reports and track KPIs
- An advantage in internships, projects, and job interviews

> Learning Excel is the first step to becoming fluent in data — and that’s exactly where my journey begins.
