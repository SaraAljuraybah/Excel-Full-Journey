# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I’m **Sara Aljreba**, an Information Technology student passionate about **data, analysis, and productivity tools**.  
I created this repository to document my **Excel learning journey** — combining technical practice with personal growth.

Through this project, I aim to:
- Strengthen my data analysis and reporting skills 🧮  
- Apply Excel in real-world problem-solving 💡  
- Showcase my continuous learning mindset 🌱  

This repo reflects how I approach learning — organized, hands-on, and focused on improvement every step of the way. 🚀
